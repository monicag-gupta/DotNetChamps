                        And stare as long as sheep or cows.

Steps:
1) Store the string in a var : x
3) query y for each char if == ','  select them put result in qm
4) foreach q qm  keep a count of q
5) print count

Count Lorem present in the following text. And print all the Lorem.
Steps:
1) Store the lines in a var : x
2) find string[] y which is split of x for " "  : var y=x.split(' ');
3) query y for each str if equals("lorem") select them put result in qm
: 
var qm=from str in y where str.Equals("Lorem") select str;
4) foreach q qm print q and keep a count of q
5) print count

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text 
of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.";
